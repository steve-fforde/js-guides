# Using React.JS for UI Guide

## What is React.JS

React is a javascript on open-source front-end library maintained by Facebook, which allows you to create responsive UI more easily, by incorporating HTML like elements directly into your code.

When combined with Redux this makes UI design simpler, as it can produce UI that respond automatically to changes in your data without needing any code to explicitly process and handle the change.
